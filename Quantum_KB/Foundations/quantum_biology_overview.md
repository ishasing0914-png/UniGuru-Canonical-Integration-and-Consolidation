Definitions
- Quantum biology: Study of quantum phenomena in biological systems and their functional significance.
- Exciton: Bound electron-hole pair important in energy transport in photosynthetic complexes.

Key Points
- Investigated phenomena: Quantum coherence in photosynthetic energy transfer, avian magnetoreception hypotheses, and tunneling in enzymatic reactions.
- Evidence and debate: Experimental signatures of short-lived coherence exist; functional relevance remains an active research area.

Concept explanations
- Photosynthetic complexes: Coherent exciton transport can enhance energy transfer under certain conditions; models use open quantum systems techniques.
- Magnetoreception: Radical-pair mechanism proposes spin-dependent chemical reactions as a compass.

Light equation context
- Open system dynamics: Master equations (Lindblad form) model environment-driven decoherence in biological contexts.
