Definitions
- Qubit: Two-level quantum system represented by state vector $|\psi\rangle=\alpha|0\rangle+\beta|1\rangle$.
- Density operator: $\rho$ describing mixed states; $\rho=\sum_i p_i|\psi_i\rangle\langle\psi_i|$.
- Unitary evolution: Closed-system dynamics described by $\rho\mapsto U\rho U^{\dagger}$.
- Measurement (projective): Born rule $p_i=\langle\psi|\Pi_i|\psi\rangle$ for projector $\Pi_i$.
- Entanglement: Non-separable joint states with correlations beyond classical mixtures.

Key Concepts
- State space: Hilbert space formalism and tensor-product composition.
- Quantum gates: Reversible operations implemented by unitary matrices.
- Quantum circuits: Composition of gates to implement algorithms.
- Quantum error: Decoherence and noise motivating error correction.

Light equation context
- State normalization: $\langle\psi|\psi\rangle=1$.
- Expectation value: $\langle A\rangle=\mathrm{Tr}(\rho A)$.

Concept explanations
- Superposition: Linear combination of basis states enabling interference.
- Measurement collapse (operational): Probabilistic update of state post-measurement.
- Quantum tomography (summary): Reconstruction of $\rho$ from measurement statistics.
