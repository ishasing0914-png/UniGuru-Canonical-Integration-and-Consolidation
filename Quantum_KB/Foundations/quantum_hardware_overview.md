Definitions
- Qubit modality: Physical implementation of a qubit (superconducting, trapped-ion, photonic, spin).
- Coherence time: Timescale over which a qubit preserves quantum phase information (T1, T2).
- Gate fidelity: Accuracy of implemented quantum gates relative to ideal unitaries.

Key Points
- Major platforms: Superconducting circuits, trapped ions, photonics, neutral atoms, and spin defects.
- Performance metrics: Qubit count, coherence times, gate fidelities, connectivity, and readout accuracy.
- Scaling challenges: Crosstalk, control electronics, cryogenics, system integration, and error correction overhead.

Concept explanations
- Superconducting qubits: Fast gates and integration with microwave control; cryogenic operation.
- Trapped ions: Long coherence, high-fidelity gates, slower gate speeds relative to superconducting.
- Photonic approaches: Room-temperature operation for certain tasks; advantages for communication.

Light equation context
- Error rates: Infidelity often expressed as $1-F$ where $F=|\mathrm{Tr}(U^{\dagger}V)|^2/\text{dim}(U)$ for ideal $U$ and implemented $V$.
