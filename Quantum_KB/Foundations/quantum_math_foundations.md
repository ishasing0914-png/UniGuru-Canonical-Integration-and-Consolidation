Definitions
- Hilbert space: Complete inner-product space over complex numbers used for quantum states.
- Linear operator: Maps between vectors in Hilbert space; observables are Hermitian operators.
- Tensor product: Formalism for composite systems $\mathcal{H}_{AB}=\mathcal{H}_A\otimes\mathcal{H}_B$.

Key Points
- Linear algebra is central: eigenvalue problems, diagonalization, singular-value decomposition.
- Operator algebra: Commutators $[A,B]=AB-BA$ and their role in uncertainty relations.
- Spectral theorem: Self-adjoint operators have real eigenvalues and an orthonormal eigenbasis.

Concept explanations
- Basis and representation: Choice of basis affects matrix representation but not physical predictions.
- Partial trace: Operation to obtain reduced states: $\rho_A=\mathrm{Tr}_B(\rho_{AB})$.

Light equation context
- Uncertainty (Robertson): $\Delta A\,\Delta B\ge\tfrac{1}{2}|\langle[A,B]\rangle|$.
