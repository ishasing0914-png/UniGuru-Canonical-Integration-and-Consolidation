Definitions
- Quantum algorithm: Algorithm exploiting quantum mechanical phenomena (superposition, interference, entanglement) to solve computational problems.
- Oracle: Abstract subroutine used in many algorithmic formulations (e.g., Grover's search).

Key Points
- Quantum speedups: Proven exponential (Shor) and quadratic (Grover) advantages for specific problems.
- Algorithm classes: Factoring and period-finding, unstructured search, simulation, optimization (VQE, QAOA).
- Resource considerations: Qubit count, gate depth, error rates, and classical-quantum hybrid steps.

Concept explanations
- Shor's algorithm: Period-finding with quantum Fourier transform yields integer factoring speedup (cite Shor 1994).
- Grover's search: Amplitude amplification producing $O(\sqrt{N})$ queries for unstructured search.
- Quantum simulation: Using quantum systems to simulate quantum chemistry and materials; basis for many near-term use cases.
- Variational algorithms: Hybrid quantum-classical optimization using parameterized circuits (VQE, QAOA) for noisy hardware.

Light equation context
- Grover iteration amplitude scaling: After $k$ iterations, success amplitude scales approximately as $\sin((2k+1)\theta)$ where $\sin(\theta)=1/\sqrt{N}$.
- Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT): Linear transform mapping computational basis to frequency domain; implemented with $O(n^2)$ gates in textbook circuits.
