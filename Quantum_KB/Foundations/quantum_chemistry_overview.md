Definitions
- Electronic structure problem: Determining ground and excited states of molecular Hamiltonians.
- Second quantization: Formalism representing fermionic creation/annihilation operators for many-body systems.

Key Points
- Quantum simulation: Mapping molecular Hamiltonians to qubit operators for simulation on quantum hardware.
- Algorithms: VQE and quantum phase estimation (QPE) are central approaches for chemistry problems.
- Resource challenges: Hamiltonian sparsity, fermion-to-qubit encodings (Jordan–Wigner, Bravyi–Kitaev), and circuit depth.

Concept explanations
- VQE: Variational hybrid algorithm optimizing parameterized circuits to approximate ground states with classical optimizers.
- QPE: High-precision eigenvalue estimation requiring deeper circuits and error-corrected hardware.
