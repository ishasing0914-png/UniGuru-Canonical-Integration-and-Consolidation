# KB_INDEX.md  
UniGuru Quantum Knowledge Base — Canonical Index

## Purpose
This document is the single authoritative index for the UniGuru Quantum Knowledge Base.
It governs structure, scope, and safety guarantees for all quantum knowledge content.

The Quantum_KB is strictly read-only, non-executable, and decoupled from runtime logic.

---

## Governance Rules
- Documentation-only knowledge corpus
- No executable files
- No imports or runtime references
- No authority or decision-making logic
- Content is reference-grade and citation-oriented

---
