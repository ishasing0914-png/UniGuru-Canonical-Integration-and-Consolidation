# UniGuru Integration Readiness Summary

## Overview

This repository represents the canonical, production-aligned UniGuru system after
consolidation of all previously approved satellite repositories.

The goal of this consolidation was to establish a single source of truth while
preserving all sovereign boundaries, safety guarantees, and approved behaviors.

No new features were added. No runtime behavior was changed.

---

## What Is Now Unified

### 1. Core Reasoning & Contracts
- UniGuru core logic
- Request/response schemas
- Boundary and enforcement interfaces
All are now located under a single governed structure.

### 2. Behavior & Safety
- Behavioral rules
- Intent handling
- Demo-safe behavior mappings
- Safety invariants and constraint tests

These are unified and verified with no agentic or execution authority.

### 3. Signal & AI Being Integration
- UniGuru signal adapter
- AI Being context contracts
- Live signal visibility verification

Signals remain non-blocking, read-only, and decision-neutral.

### 4. Karma & Prana
- Explicit documentation of read-only usage
- Confirmed non-runtime influence
- No decision authority granted

### 5. Quantum Knowledge Base
- Fully consolidated, read-only KB
- Canonical folder structure
- Single KB index
- Safety verification confirming:
  - No execution
  - No ranking changes
  - No enforcement bypass

## What Is Intentionally Deferred

- No runtime optimization
- No agentic behavior
- No tool execution
- No learning, feedback loops, or self-mutation
- No UX or demo polish beyond verification

These are explicitly out of scope.

## Safety Confirmation

This consolidation introduces:
- ❌ No new execution paths
- ❌ No authority changes
- ❌ No behavior drift

All changes are structural and documentary only.

## Status

✅ Canonical repository ready  
✅ Boundaries preserved  
✅ Safe for controlled live integration and demo use
